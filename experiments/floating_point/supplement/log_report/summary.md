# Numerical rule results

14 instances; 14 replayed; 4 accepted.

Each nonempty replicate contributes one mean across its in-domain IID scalar instances; R counts these replicates.
Out-of-domain input tuples are skipped without resampling; valid/skipped counts describe scalar tuples, not R.
z = |mean| / SE across replicate means (diagnostic only). U uses the configured magnitude gate.
B = abs(mean) + se_multiplier * SE; bias PASS requires B <= tau, in local ULPs.
Bias FAIL means an interval lies outside tolerance; INCONCLUSIVE means a boundary is crossed.
The SE bands are engineering criteria, not calibrated simultaneous or optional-stopping confidence guarantees.
Bias differences are normalized by each rounded golden value's output-format ULP before averaging.
The magnitude gate uses K=Ec/Er, the ratio of peak absolute oracle errors, without ULP normalization or an additive allowance.
Both errors zero gives K=0; a zero reference error with positive candidate error gives infinity.
K follows the FlashAttention maximum-error metric; tail extrapolation and the bias gate are additional criteria.
`empirical_max` means an observed maximum, not a fitted tail confidence bound.
Acceptance is statistical under the configured profile, not proof of strict floating-point equivalence.
Accept is pending until CPU replay. Missing statistics are shown as —, never zero.
